Graph database made by James.

## CAP Theorem
This graph database is currently only for a single server setup.
We will focus on Consistency over Availability.

#### ACID
- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability


Next step:
- [ ] https://codezup.com/building-scalable-restful-apis-with-go-and-gin-step-by-step-guide/
- [ ] file -> memory (don't hold graph in memory for now)
- [ ] check if make linux steps work
- [ ] perhaps support Cypher???
- [ ] support Edges
- [ ] support one graph algorithm
- [ ] optimize locking at worker.go
- [ ] write test in worker_test.go
